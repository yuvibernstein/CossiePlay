<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Yuval Bernstein <br>
<strong>Login:</strong> jc258588 </p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The CossiePlay website plans to increase the production and revenue, of costumes being made and sold for the cossieplay business. This will be done by promoting the cossieplay parties that occur monthly. A higher attendance to these monthly parties will result in more customers for the business. The website will focus on increasing the current estimated attendance of 30 people and a higher production of 4 costumes per week. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>During the montly parties an observation of attendance will be made in regards to the change in numbers of Cosplayers. This can be done by counting the number of people attending. Currently most cosplayers are between the ages of 35 – 50. As the website is targeting a younger audience, an evaluation will be made in regards to age of the player’s as well. This will be conducted monthly during the cosplay parties, showing if the website targeting a younger audience succeeded in this aspect of the goal. <br> In regards to costume sales an observation will be conducted monthly to measure revenue and the amount of costumes that are being made in comparison too previous years.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Currently most of the people attending the Cossieplay parties are between the age of 35 and 50, the site will be designed to appeal to a younger audience. In particular; high school kids and young adults. The site will incorporate a variation of “cool” pictures and a simple design with not too much context so that it would look appealing to this audience targeted.</p>
