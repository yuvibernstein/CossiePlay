<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The CossiePlay website plans to increase the number of people attending the CossiePlay parties and generate a higher production and revenue of costumes being made and sold for the cossieplay business. It will be aimed to appeal to a variety of ages, specifically high-school and young adults. A higher attendance to the monthly parties will result in more customers for the business. The website will focus on increasing the current estimated attendance of 30 people to a higher amount and a higher production of 4 costumes per week.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>During the montly parties an observation of attendance will be made in regards to the change in numbers of Cosplayers. This can be done by counting the number of people attending the parties at the front door before they come in. Currently most cosplayers are between the ages of 35 – 50. As the website is targeting a younger audience, an evaluation will be made in regards to the age of the player’s as well. This will also be done at the door befor entry to the party. In regards to costume sales an observation will be conducted monthly to measure revenue and the amount of costumes that are being made in comparison too previous months before the website was built.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Currently most of the people attending the Cossieplay parties are between the age of 35 and 50, the site will be designed to appeal to a younger audience. In particular, high school kids and young adults. The site will incorporate a variation of “cool” pictures and a simple design with not too much context, so that it would be easy to follow and look appealing to this targeted audience. Signing up to the monthly party will be emphasized throughout the website as a sidebar and will appeal to the age group with the use of a picture that indicates socializing with a large group of others. </p>
