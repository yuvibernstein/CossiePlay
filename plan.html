<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Yuval Bernstein <br>
<strong>Login:</strong> jc258588 </p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p> The CossiePlay website plans to increase the number of people attending the CossiePlay parties and generate a higher production of costumes being made for the CossiePlay business. Getting more people to attend the monthly party will lead to a increased amount of customers, and produce a higher number of costumes being sold. It will aim to raise awareness off CossiePlay and get more people <em> of all ages </em> CosPlaying. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> During the monthly parties an observation of attendance and age will be made. This will be done by writing down the age, and the number of CosPlayers entering the party when they pay for their party fees at the front door. In previous monthly parties an estimation of 30 people was made, an increase to this number will be attributable to the website in future months. In regards to costume sales an observation will be conducted weekly, to measure revenue and count the amount of costumes that are being made. This will be compared to previous weeks before the website was completed. </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p> CossiePlay is for all ages, although currently most people attending the Cossieplay parties are between the age of 35 and 50. The site will be designed to appeal to a younger audience, In particular high school kids and young adults. The site will incorporate a variation of “cool” Images and emphasize fun the comes from CosPlaying. People of that age group like socializing and music, so the home page will include a image indicating socializing with a large group of Cosplayers and Also an image of a DJ at the monthly party. The website will maintain simple design with not too much context (Most of the context will be scannable) so that it would be easy to follow and the targeted age group wont get bored. </p>
